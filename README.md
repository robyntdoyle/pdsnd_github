### Project Title
Getting to know Python and git for beginners

### Description
This project is about learning to do Pyhton using Bikeshare and managing version control by git.

### Files used
.gitignore
bileshare.py
README.md

### Credits
I used the notes of the Udacity Python course. If any problems did arise I used mentors through Udacity.

### Lessons Learnt
Working on highly secured work computers can cause problems not addressed in this course.

### Future Students
This course does take a considerable amount of time if you have never done this type of programming or used formal version controll before.

### Inspirations
I am inspired to learn more Pyhton, especially using the mobile app.
